# ❄️ Winter Internship 2025 – Python & Pandas

**Winter Internship 2025** is a comprehensive learning repository documenting my journey through **Core Python Programming** and **Data Analysis with Pandas**. It is structured to take learners from fundamental programming concepts to real-world data manipulation and database management.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is divided into two major learning tracks:

### 🔹 Part 1: Core Python Programming
Focuses on logic building, syntax, and application development.
* **Fundamentals:** Covers Variables, Conditionals, Loops, and Functions.
* **Advanced Concepts:** OOP (Object Oriented Programming), Scopes, and Decorators.
* **Projects:**
    * **YouTube Manager (File I/O):** A CLI app using `json` to manage video data.
    * **Database Integrations:** Variations of the manager app using **SQLite3** and **MongoDB** for data persistence.
    * **API Handling:** Scripts to fetch and process data from public APIs.

### 🔹 Part 2: Pandas (Data Analysis)
Focuses on data manipulation using the Pandas library.
* **DataFrames:** Creating, inspecting, and managing tabular data.
* **Series:** Deep dive into 1D array-like structures and broadcasting.
* **Operations:** Concatenation, Joining/Merging datasets, and handling Categorical data.
